HOW TO AUTO-UPDATE OFFSETS (When ESP/Aimbot Stops Working)
==========================================================

Roblox updates → offsets change → tool breaks.
Fix it in **2 minutes** with **Cheat Engine**.

--- STEP 1: Open Tools ---
1. Start Roblox Studio → Play Solo
2. Open Cheat Engine → Attach to `RobloxPlayerBeta.exe`

--- STEP 2: Find Health Offset ---
1. In game: Take fall damage
2. In CE: Search → Float → Your health (e.g., 85.5)
3. Take damage again → Next Scan → New health
4. Repeat until 1–2 addresses
5. Right-click → "Find what accesses this address"
6. Move in game → see register: [rbx + 0x1A0]
   → Health = 0x1A0 → update in `main.cpp`

--- STEP 3: Find Position Offset ---
1. Move your character
2. Search 3 floats: X, Y, Z (e.g., 10.2, 5.0, -3.1)
3. Move again → Next Scan
4. Find address → Dissect Data → see offset from Head
   → Usually 0x140 → update `Position = 0x140`

--- STEP 4: Find Other Offsets ---
- LocalPlayer: Search your name (string)
- Character: From LocalPlayer → +0x228
- Head: FindChild("Head") → Position + 0x140

--- STEP 5: Save & Rebuild ---
1. Edit `src/main.cpp` → update `namespace offsets`
2. Double-click `BUILD.bat`

Done! Tool works again.

Pro Tip: Roblox logs show DataModel address — tool auto-finds it!
